# QR Code Generator
I was tired of using expensive and annoying QR Code generators online. So I made a FREE and perpetual (will never expire) QR Code generator.


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the necessary python library.

```bash
pip install qrcode
```

## Usage

```python
import qrcode

# Write the data you want to store (Here, a website link)
logo = qrcode.make("https://www.JuanDavidCampolargo.com/")

#Write the name of the file and type of file (Here a jpg).
logo.save("JuanDavidCampolargo_Website_QRCode.jpg")

```
Tip: use Replit.com to get the code in 3 seconds. Copy and paste the code above and you'll have your code!
